# Altimeter-for-parachutists

This is my first project in programming. 
The code isn't well formed and the project hasn't been completed, but the programm operates correctly.
The programm was developed for the ATmega8A controller, which receives data from the BMP-180 pressure sensor via I2C (TWI) interface.
